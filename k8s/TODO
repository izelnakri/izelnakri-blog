Gitea webhooks: I need to build a custom server in node.js to re-route gitea webhooks to argo

helm minio for artifact repository

starting argo in client auth mode

make loki inside grafana automatically
make dashboard immediately available
cpu & memory management
add alerts

https://grafana.com/blog/2020/05/18/grafana-v7.0-released-new-plugin-architecture-visualizations-transformations-native-trace-support-and-more/?isource=hp
-> Grafana new version

Learn Jaeger, Harbor, Open Policy Agent, ArgoCD, Vault and maybe gitea
adding nginx + postgresql graphs automatically to graphana in prometheus-operator
Learn about Prometheus alerts
Learn about Prometheus + Loki backups(check video script + S3 trial)
Learn about canary deployments

- Streaming backups?(for logs + db backup)

loki customization(limit the log space by persisting x per day) -> backup to s3 targeted apps
